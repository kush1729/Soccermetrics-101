Soccermetrics 101

Tired of seeing your favourite sports team lose? Tired of everyone saying well they can't win whatever they do? 
Well we have the solution. There is nothing that doesn't have a solution. Sometimes you just need to look hard enough. 
We've taken information about teams and players from the top leagues of European football and are going to analyse the data to see something that not many other people see. 
Our tool allows anyone to enter the team they support and get data about it. 
Seems simple right. Well, it is. But here's where it gets complicated. 
We are going to do multidimensional graphical analysis to identify strengths and weaknesses of both players and teams. 
Secondly, we are going to bracket teams according to financial power(something nearly no one takes into consideration) and compare teams of a similar financial standing to each other. 
In essence, our tool let's you know how good a team can be and will also suggest what players/coaches it needs to do so.
